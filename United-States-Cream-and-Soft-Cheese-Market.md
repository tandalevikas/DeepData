Additionally, manufacturers have the chance to tap into the increasing demand for specialized cheese products, such as those catering to lactose-intolerant individuals or those seeking dairy-free alternatives. The growing interest in international cuisine also presents opportunities for producers to introduce exotic cheese varieties to the U.S. market. Finally, collaborations between food manufacturers and restaurants or chefs can lead to innovative cheese-based menu items, which can drive the food service sector's growth. These opportunities, when strategically harnessed, can significantly boost the market's expansion in the coming years.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>1.
