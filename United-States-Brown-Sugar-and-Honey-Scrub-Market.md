Each subsegment has experienced distinct growth patterns due to varying consumer preferences and skin concerns, contributing to the overall success of the market. The market for both facial and body skin care is driven by an increasing consumer focus on natural, effective, and sustainable products for skin health, wellness, and beauty routines.</p><h4>Facial Skin Care</h4><p>Facial skin care is one of the largest and most lucrative subsegments in the U.S. Brown Sugar and Honey Scrub Market. Scrubs formulated for the face are typically designed to offer gentle exfoliation while also nourishing and hydrating the skin. The natural components of brown sugar and honey work harmoniously to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote a more even skin tone.
